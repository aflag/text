	WELL OH WELL

I don't want a judge
No need to tell
I just want a friend
who tells me it's all well

Please don't pressure me
into thinking I gotta do something
Please don't tell me
that if you were me you'd feel in hell
that I'm lagging behind, inside a shell

I already worry too much
One worry is certainly enough

Maybe it's all in my head
and you're just being my pal
Don't mind me, man
let's just hang and have a bowl

People hang and drink to forget
I don't drink and never miss a memory
I think about the future
If you tell me to think less
worry less
do more
it won't do me no good
it's all already understood
It will only remind me of my flaws

And there are so many
I don't do what I should
I don't try hard like you would
I'm all alone and feeling the pressure
that's why I need a unpressurer
someone who will be my pal
who won't make me go through hell

Please oh please don't tell
I already know it very well
just hang with me
and be my pal
