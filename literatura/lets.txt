       LET'S

Let's go to the streets
yell our names
listen to the beats

let's hit roads
no need for money
or a car with a stereo

let's quit being alone
each and everyone

let's, let's, oh let's
don't let it be
just show us what you see

let's, let's, oh let's
let's everything
right now

          -- Rafael C. de Almeida
