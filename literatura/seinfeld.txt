1. SEINFELD's LIVING ROOM
	Kramer storms in like usual and he goes towards the kitchen. Kramer
	seems to be looking for something in the kitchen.

	SEINFELD: What are you looking for Kramer?
	KRAMER: Bread, Jerry. Bread.

	Kramer doesn't find any bread.

	KRAMER: You need more bread Jerry. How can you not have any bread?
	SEINFELD: I know! How could I do such a thing?

	Kramer finds a muffin.

	KRAMER: This is no good, I need bread.

	Kramer walks out the door. As he walks out the bell rings, it's george.

	SEINFELD: Come up.

	He says that as he opens the door downstairs through the intercom. Jerry
	shakes his head in disaproval of Kramer's attitude. He goes to the
	kitchen and starts eating the muffin Kramer found. That's when George
	comes in.

	GEORGE: Jerry, you're not going to believe it! I have date with a
	swimmer.
	JERRY: That's great George.
	GEORGE: You know how I always wanted to date an athlete!
	JERRY: I don't know. I'd feel quite pressured into being able to keep up
	with her in bed.
	GEORGE: What do you mean?
	JERRY: You know, a swimmer can have quite a lot of breath, and you...
	GEORGE: not so much...

	The bell rings again, Jerry answers it. It's Elaine. He tells her to
	come up.

	JERRY: And think about her endurance, are you willing to put that much
	effort just for a few seconds of joy?
	GEORGE: It could be a real effort. Plus, now it's offseason so she is
	not practicing really hard. She won't even be tired when we meet. What
	have a I done Jerry?
	JERRY: You could always cancel the date.
	GEORGE: Nah, I can't do that anymore. I met her through my mother. She
	was there when we setted up the date, if I don't go my mom will never
	leave me alone.

	Elaine enters.

	ELAINE: Hello. What are you boys talking about?
	JERRY: George got himself on a date with a swimmer.
	ELAINE: Really? Are you sure you can keep up with her, George?
	GEORGE: I don't know - he says nervously - quit pressuring me, ok?
	ELAINE: So, I'm walking with Mike and this friend of his bump into us.
	They say hello and then they hug. Isn't it strange, two guys hugging?
	JERRY: Well, they could be old friends who haven't seen each other in a
	long time.
	ELAINE: I don't know.
	GEORGE: It's important to know HOW they hug!
	JERRY: It's very important! Did he hold him with his right arm on the
	back and the left arm taping or only touching the other guy's shoulder
	or belly?
	ELAINE: No, they really hugged.
	GEORGE: Belly to belly?
	ELAINE: Yes.

	George and Jerry look at each other looking concerned.

	GEORGE: For how long did they hug each other?
	ELAINE: I don't know.
	JERRY: If they hugged for around three seconds, they could be old
	friends who haven't seen each other for a long time. But if they hugged
	for less than that, they could be two people who meet frequently and
	always hug each other. Two people who always hug each other wouldn't hug
	for too long.
	GEORGE: If they hug for more than three seconds it's also odd, because
	they are two friends, not two lovers. Friends don't hug each other for
	so long.

2. EXT. STREET
	Kramer is walking on the street with a bunch of bread. He's strugling
	with all the bread. Jerry comes by and sees him.

	JERRY: What are you doing with all that bread?
	KRAMER: Help me with this, Jerry.
	KRAMER: I'm doing the most popular delicacies in French cusine: Foie
	Gras.
	JERRY: Foie Gras?
	KRAMER: Yes. I feed a duck all this bread and it thanks me with his fat
	juicy liver.
	JERRY: Isn't that ilegal?
	KRAMER: Not in every state.

	Newman finds them.

	NEWMAN: Jerry.
	JERRY: Newman.
	NEWMAN: Hey, Kramer. I found a way we can get all the bread we ever
	want!
	KRAMER: Great Newman! How?

	Jerry gives Newman the bread he has taken from Kramer.

	NEWMAN: I have a friend that works in the bread disposal industry.
	JERRY: Are you going to get bread out of the trash?
	KRAMER: Ducks don't care. They'll eat it right off the floor.
	NEWMAN: Let's go Kramer.
	KRAMER: I gotta run Jerry, see you later.

3. FANCY RESTAURANT
	George is talking with the swimmer on the table.

	GEORGE: You see Lindsay, I'm the laziest person you'll ever meet. Nobody
	is lazier than me, you can ask any of my friends.
	LINDSAY: My coach always tells me that laziness is just stored energy. I
	love the challange to transform all that stored energy into activity.
	GEORGE: I'm not sure if it will ever happen. Look, it's getting late.
	Maybe we should call it a night, what do you say?
	LINDSAY: Oh, I'll make it happen.

	Lindsay jumps into George lap and starts hugging him.

4. RESTAURANT
	George and Jerry are talking in their usual table. George looks
	exhausted.

	GEORGE: I'm exhausted, Jerry.
	JERRY: I see.
	GEORGE: I can't have another night like that. What was I supposed to do
	Jerry, she threw herself at me.
	JERRY: What COULD you do?
	GEORGE: I have to find some way for her to get tired. Maybe if she has a
	hard day she will have the same energy as a normal person.
	JERRY: Why don't you just break up with her?
	GEORGE: I can't. She's just too strong, she won't let me break up with
	her. I'm her toy, Jerry.
	JERRY: Look at that woman at the counter. Why do
