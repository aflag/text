	The System


Don't know
it won't help you out
Don't know
it won't help you out

You can't like it
if you are aware
You can't enjoy your life
if the system is your wife

Don't know
it won't help you out
Don't know
it won't help you out

drink your beer
watch your football
make love in the night
to same ol' gal

Don't know
it won't help you out
Don't know
it won't help you out

sweet you've got a job
happy to take orders from Rob
Eat pancakes for breakfast
on weekends it's oktoberfest

Don't know
it won't help you out
Don't know
it won't help you out

Leaving the system you'll miss a lot
but each day at work you'll take a shot
You can't hide, there's nothing to do
if you know the system, it's already got you

Don't know
it won't help you out
Don't know
it won't help you out
