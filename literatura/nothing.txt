I spend my days
Working the codes
Working the nodes
And it's worthed
NOTHING

I waste my years
Learning useless math
Dating chicks that I don't care
And it's worthed
NOTHING

I wake up
and it's already useless
I take off home
and it's already another day gone by

Senseless
Clueless
Workless
Homeless
less less less
Good were the days they used more

Who am I kidding?
The kernel could be 9 thousand lines long
and I'd still find it too hard

Who am I kidding?
I'll never teach myself all I want
Why the hell do I keep on trying?

This song doesn't have a happy ending
and neither does life
One day you'll be dead
and everyone you liked will be crying

So please don't throw your life away
just like I do
I have no idea what you should do
only that's not what I do

This may sound gayish even emo stuff
I don't care about your judgement
And I'm not crying, no
but this sucky suckness sucks

If I had more time
If I had more friends
If I had more brains
more more more
It's just too much more!
